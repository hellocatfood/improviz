# Editors

Improviz is editor and work flow agnostic, insomuch as it just runs a web server that programs can be sent to and has no built in editing functionality.

There are basic plugins for some editors available that will handle this.

# Vim

A vim plugin is available from [https://github.com/rumblesan/improviz-client.vim](https://github.com/rumblesan/improviz-client.vim)

# Emacs

A very simple emacs plugin example is available in the *emacs* folder.
