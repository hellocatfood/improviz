# Improviz

Improviz is a live-coding environment built for creating visual performances of abstract shapes, blurred shades and broken gifs.

## Getting Started

The first step is to get the Improviz binary for your system. This can either be done by building the project from source, or more easily by downloading one of the [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/rumblesan/improviz/releases).

Once you've downloaded the release and un-archived it to a folder on your system, read the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) document.
