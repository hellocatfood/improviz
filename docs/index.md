# Improviz

Improviz is a live-coding environment built for creating visual performances of abstract shapes, blurred shades and broken gifs.

## Installation

The first step is to get the Improviz binary for your system. This can either be done by building the project from source, or more easily by downloading one of the [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/rumblesan/improviz/releases).

Once you've downloaded the release and un-archived it to a folder on your system, read the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) document.

The following documents should hopefully explain more of the ins and outs of using it.

* [Language](./language.md)
* [Interacting](./interacting.md)
* [Reference](./reference.md)
* [Textures](./textures.md)
* [Configuration](./configuration.md)

## Development

If you want to dig into the code of Improviz then the [Development](./development.md) document may be useful.
There is also the [Grammar](./grammar.md) document which tries to detail the grammar of the language, though that's less important if you're not planning to extend the language.

## Troubleshooting

There's hopefully going to be some sort of FAQ in the future, but for the time-being either [raise an issue](https://github.com/rumblesan/improviz/issues) on the repository, email me, or message me via some form of social media.
