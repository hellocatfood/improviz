# Language Reference

The Improviz language is still changing and being fleshed out. This reference should keep up with it however.

There will be many similarities to LiveCodeLab, but plenty of differences as well.

## Global Variables

*time* is the major global variable and is used for all animation, whether as default variables for commands or used by the user.

*pi*

## Functions

All functions require parentheses, with arguments separated by commas.

A blue rectangle rotating on a red background.
```
background(255, 0, 0)
fill(0, 0, 255)
rotate(time, time/10, 3)
rectangle(2, 1)
```

## Function Definition

```
val = (a) => a + 1
rotate()
fill(255, 0, 0)
box(val(1))
```

## Loops

Loops in improviz work the same as in LiveCodeLab

```
stroke(0, 0, 0)
fill(255, 0, 0)
100 times
	rotate()
	box(8, 8, 8)
```

Optional `with` variable can be used as well.

```
stroke(0, 0, 0)
fill(255, 0, 0)
100 times with i
	rotate()
  move(i)
	box(8, 8, 8)
```

Tabs are used for indentation.

## Blocks

Scoping of commands with blocks also works the same as LiveCodeLab

```
fill(255, 0, 0)
	box()
rotate()
move()
fill(0, 255, 0)
	sphere()
```
